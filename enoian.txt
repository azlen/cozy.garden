Don't just see what you expect to see
Search for the exceptional in the commonplace
Make something memorable
Don't be afraid to multiply your points of view
Follow your thinking
Share your ideas as soon as they occur
What are you really curious about?
Don't be afraid to be wrong
Remove obstacles and cultivate possibilities
Let your ideas cross-pollinate
Be open to serendipity
There is no right or wrong, only growth
The only way to learn is by doing
Everything is connected
Accept uncertainty
Try cross-pollinating concepts
Plant new seeds of curiosity
Water your imagination
Allow yourself to be playful
The more you learn, the more you grow
Challenge your assumptions
See things from a different perspective
Get out of your comfort zone
Embrace chaos
Only write when you feel inspired
Make it up as you go along
# The only way to fail is to give up
The only limit is your imagination
When in doubt, make a list
Creativity is intelligence having fun
You never know until you try
Less is more, more or less
If you're not sure what to do, do something random
Don't think, just do
The best ideas come from constraints
Constraints breed creativity
Dive into the unknown
Forget what you know
Consider the context
The best ideas come from the craziest places
Take time to explore new things
Let your imagination run wild
You can't edit a blank page
Let go of the need for perfection
Trust your instincts
Take risks and experiment
What if you did the opposite?
Let your ideas bloom
